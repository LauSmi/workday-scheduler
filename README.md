# Module 5 challenge: Work Day Scheduler

# Description:

This was a refactoring project using code provided by the UofM Bootcamp Program. I refactored the code using day.js to create a simple work day scheduler that displays the current time and date. The hour blocks run from 9am to 5pm and each block has a save button that allows text to be saved to local storage. The blocks change colors to display past, present, and future times. I also changed the styling to make it more visually appealing.

# Usage:

To use, type your to-do list in the corresponding boxes to schedule your day and click save. Text that is saved will appear after reloading the page. Boxes will change color based on past, present and future time. Feel good that you are taking steps to be more focused and organized!
